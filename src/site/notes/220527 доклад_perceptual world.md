> ‚ÄúThese indications must suffice to understand the sense of the retrogression from predicative to pre-predicative, objectual evidence, a retrogression which coincides with the retrogression to the evidence of life-worldly experience‚Äù ([[@husserl1973c|Experience and Judgment]], 51).

> Hence Husserl establishes a distinction between the a prio ri pertaining to the perceptual world (lebensweltliches Apriori) and the logico-objective a priori of the exact sciences. If, as it must be, the former is made the theme of special investigations, there arises the idea of an "ontology of the life-world", an a priori science of the universal structures of the perceptual world, a science whose objective is the systematic description of the categorial constitution of that world, the explicit articulation of the "notion of the natural world" (nat√ºrlicher Weltbegriff). Husserl conceives of a "transcendental aesthetics" in a sense different from that which Kant gave to the term, though not totally unrelated to it. Transcendental aesthetics in HusserI's sense concerns itself with the "eidetische Problem einer m√∂glichen Welt √ºberhaupt als Welt 'reiner Erfahrung"'. It is to provide "eine eidetische Deskription des universalen Apriori, ohne welches in blo√üer Erfahrung... einheitlich Objekte nicht erscheinen und so √ºberhaupt Einheit einer Natur, einer Welt sich... nicht konstituieren k√∂nnte". ([[@gurwitsch1970|Gurwitsch 1970]], 58)

> Husserl attempts to arrive at a common structure shared by all diverse cultural world by considering the relative worlds solely in terms of their invariant and unchanging structures, irrespective of their layered on cultural senses. He does this by employing the method of eidetic variation. What remains is a perceptual world‚Ä¶ The perceptual world is the ‚Äòlifeworld a priori‚Äù distinct form the objective-logical a priori of the objective sciences. The relative cultural worlds are all ‚Äòbound‚Äô to the singular one world‚Ä¶ Here the lifeworld a priori functions in relation to the diverse cultural lifeworlds as an eidos does in relation to its particular instances‚Äù ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 96).

> The form of the world-horizon, its eidos, then, is minimally this graduated horizon of the perceptual field that makes possible the experience of an individual object and a space traversable beyond the immediately given perceptual field. ([[@bower2013|Bower 2013]], 48-49).
