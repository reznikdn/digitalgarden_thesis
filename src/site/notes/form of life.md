# form of life
- There are: [[vertical sense of the form of life|vertical sense of the form of life]] & [[horizontal sense of the form of life|horizontal sense of the form of life]] ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]]; see also [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26; [[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424).
- There are: [[human form of life|human form of life]] & [[form of human life|form of human life]] ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 78; see also [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	-  “One could say that all humans participate in the human form of life, but that there can be different forms of human life” ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 78).
	- Conway distinguishes the human 0 from the 0 of other beings, but takes the crucial dichotomy for [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] to be the one human 0 versus the different 0 ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	- “Where the acquisition of [[language|language]] belongs to the human 0, the acquisition of cartography, of algebra, or of parliamentary elections attaches only to some of the various forms of human life” ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 27).
- To imagine a [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] is to imagine a form of life ([[@wittgenstein2009|PI]], §19).
	- The idea of language as a form of life, like the idea of a [[language-game|language-game]], is to be set over against the idea of language as an abstract system of signs for representing how things are ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 54-55).
	- Form of life is intended to evoke the idea that speaking a language is a way of conducting oneself with words in a life with others ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 55).
- Form of life is shaped by the use of language ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 62).
	- That precisely means that our form of life is fundamentally cultural in nature ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 62).
- “The 0 is not grounded on something more fundamental; it is the fundament” ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 24).
- 0 is a stopping-place of doubt; 0 is a place of complete agreement, without which human beings could learn no [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 23-24).
- 0 is not a single way of acting, but must include innumerable other such shared ways of acting that cohesively form the necessary background or context or foundation of meaning ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 25).
- 0 is the actions intertwined with [[language use|language use]] within a given [[culture|culture]] ([[@gonzalez-castan2016|González-Castán 2016]], 123).
- 0 is the [[sociology|sociological]], [[history (science)|historical]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] determinants that comprise the matrix within which a given [[language|language]] has meaning ([[@gonzalez-castan2016|González-Castán 2016]], 123).
- The distinction on biological and ethnological kinds of form of life sets the fase primacy of biological under the cultural ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 30-32).
	- To the [[human form of life|human form of life]] as the general form of human being belongs no only [[extremely general facts of nature|extremely general facts of nature]]. Language, for example is the “second nature we all share” ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 30).
	- “It is impossible to superimpose on man a lower layer of behaviour which one chooses to call ‘natural’, followed by a manufactured cultural or spiritual world. Everything is both manufactured and natural in man, as it were, in the sense that there is not a word, not a form of behaviour which does not owe something to purely biological being – and which at the same time does not elude the simplicity of animal life, and cause forms of vital behaviour to deviate from their pre-ordained direction, through a sort of leakage and through a genius for ambiguity which might serve to define man.” ([[@merleau-ponty2012|Merleau-Ponty 2012]], 220)
	- There is “the mutual absorption of the natural and the social” ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]], 330). “The human is irreducibly social and natural” ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]], 353).
- [[extremely general facts of nature|Extremely general facts of nature]] that belong to our human 0 are objects of [[certainty (Wittgenstein)|certainty]] for all humans ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 27).
- Facts that frame the various 0 of human life are objects of [[certainty (Wittgenstein)|certainty]] for only some humans depending on [[culture|culture]], [[society|society]], [[education|education]], interest etc. ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 27).
- The secondary literature concerning the 0 has primarily focused on the question of whether there is only one shared human form of life or multiple forms of life ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 97).
	- This situation (as is commonly known) arose in connection with [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein’s]] use of the term in [[@wittgenstein2009|Philosophical Investigations]] both in the singular and plural form ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 97).
	- This situation is mirrored in the discussion of [[the form of life & a form of life|the form of life & a form of life]].
