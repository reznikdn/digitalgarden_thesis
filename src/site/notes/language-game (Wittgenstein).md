# language-game (Wittgenstein)
- 0 is bound-up with the non-linguistic behaviour.
	- [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] introduces the language-game in order to bring into prominence the fact that [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] functions within the active, practical lives of speakers; its use is inextricably bound up with the non-linguistic behaviour which constitutes its natural environment ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 47). 
	- Language is embedded within the horizon of significant, non-linguistic behaviour ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 55). Витгенштейн
- 0 is not an abstract system of signs.
	- Wittgenstein’s concept of a language-game is set over the idea of language as a system of signs that can be considered in abstraction from its actual employment ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 48). 
	- Language is not a system of signs with meaning; but it is embedded in the lives of those who speak it. ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 48).
- 0 emphasizes the fact that the speaking of [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] is part of [[form of life (Wittgenstein)|form of life]] ([[@wittgenstein2009|PI]], §23).
	- Language is woven in with the countless activities that make up our form of life ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 61).
- 0 constitute a special form, namely, a form of activity or of behaviour ([[@garver1994|Garver 1994]], 246).
- 0 is not isolated [[practice|practice]] or activity, but rather it belong to a larger context ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 100).
- 0 is not linked to eternal and unchanging essences ([[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]], § 23).
- Our linguistic practices are not foundationless; rather they are grounded in enduring and persistent ways of acting ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 103).
- Without a background of [[practice|practices]], one cannot participate in or play the individual language-games ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 110).
