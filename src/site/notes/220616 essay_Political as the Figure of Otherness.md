# Political as a Figure of Otherness
## 1. Introduction
В немногочисленной политически искушённой феноменологической литературе, ориентированной на методологию Гуссерля, есть своеобразный пробел. Эта литература останавливается на активном генезисе политического и на его экспликации как исторического априори, имеющего собственный акт протоучреждения в генеративной истории общности.

Политичское в этой литературе не подвергается тарнсцендентально-археологическому исследованию, проникающему в пассивные слои опыта.

Интуицию такого исследования мы находим в экзистенциальлном прочтении *Понятия политического* Шмитта. В нём политическое базируется на различении друга и врага, где враг в радикальном прочтении оказывается сущностью меня самого – враг становится мои собственным вопросом самому себе, призываом к себя и призывом себя к ответу.

Шмиттовское политическое позволяет свзяать политическую феноменологию с понятия чужого как конститутивной основы всякого опыта.

В такой феноменологической археологии инаковости, проводником к которой выступает Шмитт, мы совершаем обратное движение (Aufbau) и обнаруживаем, что политическое как активное столкновение частных миров, если мы берём его в пассивноом генезисе, выстпает как телеологическое движениеот радикальной инаковости, которая есть суть ядро субъективности как таковоой. Политическое – это априорное учреждение теологического движение Мы-субъективности, общности.


## 2. Ontology of the Political World
1. The [[world (Husserl)|world]] (Welt) is synonymous with the [[life-world (Husserl)|life-world]] (Lebenswelt) and the [[experienced world|experienced world]] (Erfahrungswelt).
	- We can use these concepts interchangeably. It is assumed that the difference between them is the difference in the shading of the concept of the world itself. Life-world is used in the context of the world's opposition to the objectivism of modern sciences (e.g., [[@mensch2017|Mensch 2017]]); experienced world is often used in the sense of [[perceptual world|perceptual world]] (e.g., [[@geniusas2012|Geniusas 2012]], 195-208).
2. The world is a multidimensional sense-formation (multidimensionales Sinngebilde) ([[@sowa2008|Sowa 2008]], LXI; see also [[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 49-50).
	- We can distinguish [[transcendental concept of the world|transcendental]] and [[natural concept of the world|natural]] senses of the world; concern it as the [[world as totality|totality]] or as the [[world-horizon|horizon]]; take it in general or differentiate its [[perceptual world|perceptual]] and [[cultural world|cultural]] layers. [[Husserl|Husserl’s]] [[phenomenology|phenomenology]] expresses the  plurality of our understandings of the world.
3. There is a plurality of [[particular world|particular worlds]].
	- One way of understanding the world is to consider it in terms of the plurality of the particular or relative worlds. We are always inhabit the interweaving of the particular worlds: economic world, scientist-world, historical world, student-world, Russian-world, etc. These worlds are characterized by their own [[horizon|horizons]] of beliefs, practices, customs, traditions and other figures of horizonal relatedness, such as valuableness or meaningfulness.
	- On the first sight the phenomenon of the particular worlds can be best understood as the relativistic plurality of cultural worlds with their own truths and blind spots.
4. There is a distinction between concrete, typical and essential kinds of particular worlds.
	- All concretely considered particular worlds are intertwined. An economic world is never a pure world of economic [[horizon|horizons]]. It is intertwined with the children's, commercial, architectural, scholarly, and other particular worlds. In the logic of concreteness there is no the “economic world” but the “Russian-middle-class-student-atheistic-militant-economic-world” among other concrete economic worlds shared by [[community (Husserl)|communities]]. The extreme point of concretization would be the complete blurring of the boundaries between particular worlds and the establishment of a radical [[relativism|relativistic perspective]], in which there is only my one and only unique world.
	- That is ==дописать==
5. There is a political world.
6. Political world should have its concrete, typical and essential forms.
7. Political world should have its own way of [[appearance|appearance]] and [[thematization|thematization]].
	- And therefore an [[ontology of the life-world|ontology of the political world]] is possible.

Klaus Held offers the following way of disclosing the phenomenon of the [[political world|political world]]: ==дописать про Миеттинена и про то, что я не только из них вообще то беру== (see [[@depraz1995a|Depraz 1995]]; [[@held2012|Held 2012]]; [[@drummond2000|Drummond 2000]]; [[@miettinen2015|Miettinen 2015]]; [[@miettinen2020|Miettinen 2020]], 83-135):

8. There is a distinction between the [[the one world|world as such]] and the plurality of the [[particular world|particular worlds]].
	- The postulate of [[natural attitude|natural attitude]] presupposes that every our action directed toward things, deeds, plans, and concerns, conceals the [[horizon (Husserl)|horizons]] through which any directionality becomes possible at all. The [[situation|situation]] itself and the structure of [[habituality (Husserl)|habitualities]] must stay in the background so that we are able to deal with the foreground. Of course, sometimes the background reveals itself: we notice that “we are in an awkward situation”, that “it is only our opinion”, that “we are in a wrong place“. But the key achievement of the natural attitude is that when we notice the background, we immediately change this noticing on the new interpretation, on the new foreground. Our experience stays [[concordance|concordant]] and unanimous. Yes, we misunderstood the situation, we misunderstood the state of affairs. But the break of the situation does not lead to the breaking of the whole world: I am still a human being in the world, I still stay on their own two feet. The natural attitude presupposes the unthematizable and uninterrupted world as [[the one world|the one world]], as an all-encompassing [[universal horizon|universal horizon]] in which all our particular horizons are nested and change each other.
9. The one world could be thematized through the break of the natural attitude / The one world could be thematized through the institution of the philosophical attitude.
	- The [[philosophical attitude|philosophical attitude]] first established by [[Heraclitus|Heraclitus]] allows us to break this spell of naturalness, to cast off the shackles of confinement in the particular worlds and to [[thematization|thematize]] the world as [[the one world|the one world]]. [[philosophy|Philosophy]] makes it possible for the first time to grasp the world as our “common” world and to distinguish it from the plurality of the ==doxa==.
10. Because the philosophical attitude exists, there should be its condition of possibility.
	- The institution of the philosophical attitude does not come from nothing. If it is possible at all, then we must have a possibility of temporally removing the spell of doxa; we are not the eternal prisoners of our particular horizons. Because there is an [[episteme|episteme]], there must be some world-open form of doxa, which is not yet episteme. There sould be a "mediator" between doxa and episteme ==добавить ссылку==.
11. We have an ability to thematize our own absorption by doxa and have an awareness of the [[the other|others']] [[horizon|horizons]].
	- We know that there particular worlds to which we do not belong and which we hardly even understand. Even so, we are still aware that they exist, that they presuppose their own horizons of significance, practices and beliefs. And we are able to learn to understand them.
12. In order to be thematizable the other particular world should present itself / The co-presence of the other particular world is the condition of its thematization.

In n.12 the political world is finally reveals itself:

13. Political world is a horizon of the co-presence and co-encounter of the particular worlds' totality. 
	- Held says that the political originated when ==дописать==
	- Miettinen argues that [[theoretical attitude|theoretical attitude]] and [[philosophy|philosophy]] itself originated from the Greek practice of *theoria*, that is a “kind of anthropological field of study or ‘travelogue’ that aimed at providing information on the beliefs and practices of individual city states” ([[@miettinen2015|Miettinen 2015]], 243).
14. Political world is a mediator between the natural attitude and the philosophical attitude.

For now, we shouldn't be interested in in examining exactly when and where the political was inaugurated: within the “many” of one polis, in the cultural exchange between them, or somewhere and sometime else. These nuances could certainly be phenomenologically explicated. ==дописать==

15. As a particular world political world should have its own event of [[primal institution|primal institution]] (Urstiftung) in the generative history of the [[community (Husserl)|community]].

==Здесь написать, что объяснения Хельда не хватает. Оно застревает на на “политическом пространстве” обсуждения собственных горизонтов. Радикализация рассуждения Хельда – это рассмотрение политического как инаковости, как чуждости, как враждебности, как другого способа жизни, задающего вопрос твоему собственному. Как чужому горизонту, с которым ты сталкиваешься. Это объяснение мы находим в философии Шмитта в её экзистенциально-политической интерпретации”.

## 3. The Enemy as the Constitutional Condition of the Political World
То, что нас интересует в феноменологической экспликации политического у Хельда – это прежде всего рассмотрение политического как столкновения частных миров. Хельд говорит об этом столкновении как об открытии “политического пространства”, в котором частные мира из со-присутствующих становятся взаимо-обсуждаемыми. Но можем ли мы радикализировать эту позицию? Можем ли обнаружить ещё более фундаментальную сущность политического, которое лежало бы в основе описания Хельда? Я полагаю, что обращаясь к работам Шмитта, мы действительно может совершить такой ход.




There are some preliminary assumptions to be introduced in order to make valid the following reasoning.

- [[Schmitt|Schmitt]] argues that the enemy is solely the public enemy ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 28) and that a private  person has no political enemies ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 51).
- Schmitt argues that there is a [[way of life (Schmitt)|way of life]] (/form of existence) which I share with my community ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 27ff.).
- Schmitt claims that the [[political (Schmitt)|political]] is not a domain (/sphere /substance) ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 38).
	- Schmitt proposes to view the political not as “other” domains but as a form or a structure of their interrelations (see ==n.== ).

As an addition or counterargument to ==nn.==, let us suppose that: 

- The way of life is identical with the concrete [[particular world|particular world]].
	- See ==n.== It could also be equated with many other synonymous concepts in other philosophical systems. For example, with the [[form of human life|forms of human life]] in [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein’s]] philosophy.
- The political as the non-substantial antithesis is identical with the [[essence (Husserl)|essence]] of the political world as a particular world.
	- The political world as ==n.==  can be considered through the conceptual framework of [[essence (Husserl)|essence]] and [[eidetic reduction|eidetic reduction]] in [[Husserl|Husserl’s]] [[phenomenology|phenomenology]]. The formal representation of the political in Schmitt’s philosophy could also be applied to many other particular worlds. For example, a [[historical world|historical world]] can also be considered, on the one hand, as a concrete historical horizon of a culture and, on the other hand, as the essential structure of any concrete particular world. Non-substantially considered [[history|history]] is, roughly speaking, a [[horizon|horizon]] of preservation, “passing forward” and appropriation of community’s sense-formations. And such a representation of the historical world is parallel to Schmitt's non-substantial representation of the political.
	- Just like the political world, – which is not the constant structure of the communities (e.g., [[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 35, 39), – the historical world is the [[historical a priori (Husserl)|historical a priori]] which, paradoxically, has its own act of [[primal institution|primal institution]]. There should be a point and place in the history of [[community (Husserl)|community]] when the historical as such was inaugurated. There could be (and actually were) communities that know no history (e.g., [[@moran2011|Moran 2011]], 466f.).

Although ==n.==, there are two important nuances to be made here. The first one (==n.==) is the argument below. And the second one (==n.==) will be made at the end of the section.

- The [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] is not only the group’s enemy, but also the enemy for me-as-a-member-of-the-group.
	-  Of course, by the thesis “the enemy is solely the public enemy” Schmitt highlights significant difference between the *hostis* and the *inimicus*. But on the other hand, as a member of the group, I am also involved in the confrontation with the enemy. He is an enemy of the particular world which I also share with my friends.

With ==nn.==  in mind, let us reproduce Schmitt's existential reading from the encounter of private worlds to the postulation of the existential status of the enemy 

 - The [[political (Schmitt)|political]] in [[Schmitt|Schmitt’s]] philosophy describes “the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 38).
	 - The political consist of the degree of intensity at which other spheres are politicized ([[@sartori1989|Sartori 1989]], 65). “Political questions cannot be dealt with only politically” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 96). Every sphere is potentially political due to a possible increase in the intensities of association and dissociation structuring it ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 65).
- The utmost degree of intensity of an association or dissociation is denoted by the [[friend-enemy distinction (Schmitt)|friend-enemy criterion (Schmitt)]] ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
	- And the greater the intensity of antagonism between the groups, the stronger this distinction. As the presence of the political determines through possibility (namely, through the possibility of [[war (Schmitt)|war]]), so too the enemy as a potential enemy is always present in the dissociation between the groups.
- The friend-enemy distinction is the foundation of the political itself / The friend-enemy distinction constitutes the political ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
- The [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] is the one who is able to destroy my way of life (see [[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 49; see also [[@norris1998|Norris 1998]], 75-76).
	- The confrontation between groups is based not on their pure co-presence but on the radical otherness of their ways of life. The other way of life that is strange to me, can be destructive for my own particular world. 
- The enemy is the one who existentially puts me in question ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87-88).
	- The possibility of destroying my way of life necessarily calls it into question. Moreover, this question is meant in an existential sense – in the sense of a call for establishment and thematization of one's own horizons. What way of life does my enemy potentially destroy? Is this way of life worth defending? The enemy is defined by this very act of questioning. He doles out my [[identity|identity]] to me by this very act ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 88). 

Until ==n.== Schmitt’s arguments can be considered as the continuation of analysis of the encounter between communities’ particular worlds. We could call his reasoning an ontology of the political world (see [[@bergo2019|Bergo 2019]]). But here comes the turning point. Schmitt argues:

- The [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] is *my own* question ([[@schmitt1991|Schmitt 1991]], 243; [[@schmitt2002|Schmitt 2002]], 89-90).

We can claim that in light of ==n.==, the statement ==n.== is a contradiction. ==n.== presuppose that the enemy can question me only as the member of the community with an intersubjectively shared way of life. But in ==n.== there is no any community. I suppose that in order to prevent the contradiction we should make the following move:

- It is a distinction between 1) the enemy as a bearer of horizons unfamiliar to me that call into question my own way of life and 2) the enemy as a radical alienness within me, by virtue of which I, as a subject with my own perspective, am possible at all.
- The sense of the enemy as the alien is guided by the motive of [[dismantling|dismantlement]] of the particular worlds and getting the primordial sphere which is constitutive for any plurality of perspectives.

We should concern the ==n.== in more detail. ==дописать==.

## 4. The Alien Core of the Enemy


- There is a distinction between the other and the alien
