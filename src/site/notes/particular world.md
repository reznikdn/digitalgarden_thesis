# particular world
- 0 is “a” world ([[@held2012|Held 2012]], 448).
	- It is possible to use term “world” in the meaning of the many “worlds” – that is , those various [[horizon|horizons]] of which we can consider many empirical examples ([[@held2012|Held 2012]], 448).
	- See [[the world & a world|the world & a world]] for more information.
- 0 is synonymous with the [[form of human life|form of human life]] in [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein’s]] philosophy (R.D., 220530).
- Since the different kinds of human goals are interwoven with different kinds of human interests as their origin, [[Husserl|Husserl]] calls our 0 our “Interessen-Horizont” ([[@husserl1954|Hua VI]], 459/379; see also [[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 54).
- Since the 0 its own “particular universality”, it can be divided into sub-particular worlds, each of which can once again be divided into sub-sub-particular worlds, etc. ([[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 55).
- 0 is the topic of various kinds of empirical sciences ([[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 55).
	- For example, it can be investigated as the topic of [[history (science)|history (science)]]: “historians who have to reconstruct the changing living environments of the peoples and times that they deal with” ([[@husserl1954|Hua VI]], 150/144).
- [[life-world (Husserl)|Life-world]] as the general life-world is the foundation of the different kinds of particular worlds ([[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 55).
	- As the foundation, the general life-world can be defined as a mixture of different kinds of particular worlds. “Aber all diese Allheiten (of the special worlds) fügen sich der Welt ein, die alles Seiende und alle seienden Allheiten wie all ihre Zwecke und bezweckenden Menschen und Menschenheiten umspannt” ([[@husserl1954|Hua VI]], 460/381).
- There is a distinction between concrete, typical and essential kinds of 0
	- All concretely considered particular worlds are intertwined. An economic world is never a pure world of economic [[horizon|horizons]]. It is intertwined with the children's, commercial, architectural, scholarly, and other particular worlds. In the logic of concreteness there is no the “economic world” but the “Russian-middle-class-student-atheistic-militant-economic-world” among other concrete economic worlds shared by [[community (Husserl)|communities]]. The extreme point of concretization would be the complete blurring of the boundaries between particular worlds and the establishment of a radical [[relativism|relativistic perspective]], in which there is only my one and only unique world.
	- Every particular world is a [[type|typical]] world to. We grasp it and are able to explicate it in its typical properties and horizons cut off from other particular worlds. This allows us to speak of particular worlds as common to a set of other particular worlds (on the concept of type in Husserl’s phenomenology see, e.g., [[@lohmar2003|Lohmar 2003]], [[@schutz1966b|Schutz 1966]]).
	- Every particular world has its [[essence|essence]] (/essential structure /eidos /eidetical structure), i.e. a set of properties and rules that are true for any (including potential) selected concrete particular world. We can speak both of the essence of “the” particular world itself and of the essence of “a” particular world (economic world, military world, and so on) – the essence of the first embraces the essence of the second (on the concept of essence in Husserl’s phenomenology see, e.g., [[@sowa2010|Sowa 2010]], [[@majolino2015|Majolino 2015]]).
