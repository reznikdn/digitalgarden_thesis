# political (Schmitt)
- It is doubtful whether the 0 has its own area ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 63).
	- “Is it conceivable that a book investigating the concept of the 0 would deny the existence of an autonomous political sphere, field, or domain? Isn’t it the explicit task of the text at hand to delimit such a sphere, separating it from what is not political? Or else, what are we to make [[Schmitt|Schmitt’s]] odd contention that the 0 parasitically inhabits other regions of human activity but lacks a domain of its own?” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 63)
 - 0 describes not “its own substance but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 38).
	 - In this citation George Schwab translates Sachgebiet as “substance”. But usually he translates it as “domain” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 63).
	- In return for giving up the right to a domain of its own, the political comes to reside in all other domains as a possibility related to the varying intensities of oppositions peculiar to them ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 63).
	- [[Schmitt|Schmitt]] inscribes his discussion of the political in a kind of negative ontology, the non-space, or, better yet, in the displacement of different domains of human action ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 64).
	- There is no such thing as an actual political sphere because every sphere is potentially political due to a possible increase in the intensities of association and dissociation structuring it ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 65).
	- 0 is not the most basic stratum propping up the rest of the edifice of human thought and action, but a veritable earthquake that, in bestowing meaning on the categories of human existence, disarticulates, unhinges, or ungrounds the latter and, in this unhinging, absorbs every sphere of life ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 67-68).
- 0 has a groundless character ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 68).
- “A definition of the 0 can be obtained only by discovering and defining the specifically political categories” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 25).
	- In contrast to relatively independent endeavors (moral, aesthetic, economic and so on) the 0 has its own criteria which express themselves in a characteristic way ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 25-26).
	- 0 mus rest on its own ultimate distinctions ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
- The final 0 distinction is the distinction between [[friend-enemy distinction (Schmitt)|friend and enemy]] ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
	- This arguments is stated on the ground of analogy with other “relatively independent endeavors”: “in the realm of morality the final distinctions are between good and evil, in aesthetics beautiful and ugly, in economics profitable and unprofitable” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
	- This distinction provides a definition in the sense of a criterion ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
- The 0 antagonism is the most intense and extreme antagonism ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 29).
	- Every concrete antagonism becomes that much more political the closer it approaches the most extreme point, that of the [[friend-enemy distinction (Schmitt)|friend-enemy]] grouping ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 29).
- Political world is a pluriverse, not a universe ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 53).
- “Political questions cannot be dealt with only politically” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 96).
- 0 has an existential priority over all other forms of association ([[@norris1998|Norris 1998]], 75).
- 0 is the first and the last non-objective ground of collective existence ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 120).
- 0 describes not “its own substance but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 38).
	- 0 consist of the degree of intensity at which other spheres, or better other antitheses lose their identity and are politicized ([[@sartori1989|Sartori 1989]], 65).
	- “[[Schmitt|Schmitt]] does not admit a sphere of politics quae per se est et per se concipitur, which stands by itself and can be conceived in itself. For him the political is the intensity that regroups us into aggregates of friends versus [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemies]] ([[@sartori1989|Sartori 1989]], 65).
- McCormick argues that the 0 is “the transhistorically legitimated human propensity toward violent existential conflict” ([[@mccormick1999|McCormick 1999]], 17, 96, 110).
- McCormick argues that the 0, the postulation of an [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] “serves to distract from the discomfort… of not knowing who oneself (or) one’s culture… is in modernity” ([[@mccormick1999|McCormick 1999]], 233).
- Strauss argues that “the affirmation of the 0 is the affirmation of fighting as such, wholly irrespective of what is being fought for” ([[@strauss2008|Strauss 2008]], 120).
- “The 0 does not reside in the battle itself… but in the mode of behaviour which is determined by this possibility” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 37).
	- Norris argues that this mode of behaviour is a solidarity that makes possible both sefl-sacrifice and [[political authority (Schmitt)|political authority]] ([[@norris1998|Norris 1998]], 77).
- Marder argues that “the question is the essence of the political, while the political is the essence of the human” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
