# friend-enemy distinction (Schmitt)
- 0 is independent not in the sense of a distinct new domain ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
- 0 denotes the utmost degree of intensity of a union or separation, of an association or dissociation ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 26).
- “The friend, [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]], and combat concepts receive their real meaning precisely because they refer to the real possibility of physical killing” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 33).
- Friend-enemy are not individuals but collectivities ([[@sartori1989|Sartori 1989]], 65).
- Sartori is not convinced that the “intensity” is an exclusive prerogative of the [[political|political]] ([[@sartori1989|Sartori 1989]], 66).
- 0 is an existential decision which cannot be anticipated by law ([[@norris1998|Norris 1998]], 68).
- 0 constitutes the [[political|political]] ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
- 0 is a prototype of all difference ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
- 0 is a mechanism of distantiation (including self-distantiation) ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
