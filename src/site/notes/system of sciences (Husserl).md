## Problems of the Husserl’s system of sciences
- general problems of demarcation in Husserl’s system of sciences
	- [[Юдин|Юдин]] highlights the following 0 ([[@yudin2012|@yudin2012]], 100-108):
	1. It is difficult to distinguish between [[transcendental phenomenology|transcendental phenomenology]] and ontologies ([[regional ontology|regional ontologies]] and [[formal ontology|formal ontology]]) ([[@yudin2012|@yudin2012]], 100-102). The basic principle of distinction is that in ontologies we judge what corresponds to certain [[object (Husserl)|objects]] “as such”. Transcendental phenomenology in its turn considers how these objects are [[constitution (Husserl)|constituted]] in [[transcendental subjectivity|transcendental subjectivity]]. The problem here is that many of the results that will be obtained in ontologies are already implied in transcendental phenomenology. (in this context see also [[@olesen1997|Olesen 1997]]). 
	2. Difficulties in distinguishing between [[regional ontology|regional ontologies]] и [[empirical sciences|empirical sciences]] ([[@yudin2012|Юдин 2012]], 103). Their distinction must be based on method: for regional ontologies it is eidetical (see [[eidetic reduction|eidetic reduction]]); for empirical sciences it is [[induction|inductive]]. However, Yudin argues that [[Husserl|Husserl]] is ultimately forced to admit that "all the sciences of onta, both rational and empirical, can be called 'ontologies' in a broad sense, since they are concerned with the unities of '[[constitution (Husserl)|constitution]]'".
	3. The problem of distinguishing between [[transcendental phenomenology|transcendental phenomenology]] and [[phenomenological psychology|phenomenological psychology]] ([[@yudin2012|Юдин 2012]], 103-106). It is assumed that phenomenological psychology carried out to its logical conclusion is transcendental phenomenology. This problem is also related to 1) the problem of illegitimate transition from phenomenological psychology to transcendental phenomenology; and to 2) the problem of inequality of regional ontologies.
- problem of illegitimate transition from phenomenological psychology to transcendental phenomenology
	- [[Kern|Kern]] suppose that blurred border between [[phenomenological psychology|phenomenological psychology]] and [[transcendental phenomenology|transcendental phenomenology]] and the implied possibility of switching between them are illegitimate and are equivalent to the same transition to [[philosophy|philosophy]] from the [[regional ontology|regional ontology]] of [[region of nature|region of nature]], that is, to the very [[naturalism|naturalism]] in philosophy that [[Husserl|Husserl]] so actively criticized ([[@kern1977|Kern 1977]], 136; cit. by [[@yudin2012|Юдин 2012]], 106).
- problem of inequality of regional ontologies
	- [[Husserl|Husserl’s]] system of sciences presupposes the epistemological and ontological equality between [[regional ontology|regional ontologies]]. But [[Юдин|Юдин]] suggests that this principle is false ([[@yudin2012|Юдин 2012]], 107). He claims that Husserl's overcoming of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian dualism]], which was preserved in the teachings of [[Dilthey|Dilthey]] and [[Brentano|Brentano]], means that the fight against [[naturalism|naturalism]] in [[psychology|psychology]] is not limited to the allocation of the sphere of "internal experience" inaccessible to [[natural sciences|natural science]], but leads to the problem of [[constitution (Husserl)|constituting]] [[region of nature|region of nature]] as objectivity in [[consciousness|consciousness]]. [[regional ontology|Eidetics]] not only discovers for itself the field of psychological research, as was assumed at the early stages of the development of Husserlian [[phenomenology|phenomenology]], but reinterprets other [[region|regions]] and thereby expands to the dimensions of a universal ontology. [[nature & spirit (Husserl)|Nature and spirit]] cannot be side by side regions simply because they are not equal in their relation to [[transcendental subjectivity|constitutive subjectivity]].
