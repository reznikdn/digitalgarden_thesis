	- “If [[language|language]] is a set of [[custom|customs]] in which words play a role, and if language develops out of an earlier set of proto-customs, then it seems plausible to suppose that certain customs are to be found in every human [[society|society]]. The hypothesis is, in particular, that every extant or historically known human [[culture|culture]] has [[language-game (Wittgenstein)|language-games]] of greeting, requesting, responding to requests, refusing, responding to prohibitions, make-believe, intйention-utterance, responding to intention-utterance, and possession-claiming. Across the vast differences between the various human cultures, one finds those customs, and others, as a common factor. ([[@canfield2007|Canfield 2007]], 73).
