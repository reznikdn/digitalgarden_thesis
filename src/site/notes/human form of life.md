# human form of life
- 0 is identified with “the” form of life.
- 0 consist of basic human activities and [[practice|practices]] that are rooted in man's biological and social nature ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 141).
- The ways in which these basic activities and practices are carried on vary considerably from one [[culture|culture]] to another, but they are universal and easily recognizable in any culture ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 145).
	- 0 provides us a foothold when we try to understand [[belief|beliefs]], uses of [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]], [[practice|practices]] and [[institution|institutions]] in a foreign [[culture|culture]]. In case of “the” form of life we are dealing with no boundaries prohibiting our ability to understand other [[culture|cultures]] ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 98).
- 0 is “the common behaviour of mankind”, the basic “regular ways of acting” ([[@wittgenstein1993|Wittgenstein 1993]], 397) shared by all human beings ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 34; [[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 102-103).
	- “The common behaviour of mankind is the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown language” ([[@wittgenstein1997|Wittgenstein 1997]], 206).
	- 0 is this universally-shared human behaviour, to which patterns of life and language-games belong, that constitutes the bedrock from which any human being can begin to understand another human being, and from which any human being must begin to make sense ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 39).
	- 0 cut across cultural boundaries, because they are basic forms that human life takes in all cultures ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 141). 0 is a form of life that human life takes in all [[culture (Wittgenstein)|cultures]].
	- “The common behaviour of mankind is the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown [[language|language]]” ([[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]], § 206). By the common behaviour of mankind [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] refers to basic activities and practices that occur in all cultures ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 148).
- 0 is natural histories of human beings ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 102-103).
	- That means that they are necessary in the sense that we have to engage in them in order to be able to live in our society.
	- Basic activities and practices are part of our [[natural history|natural history]] ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 146).
- 0 has three main aspects: it involve basic activities & a biological aspect & it involve some transcendental conditions that must be satisfied for us to be able to live in our society ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 145).
	- These basic activities are, for example, building shelters, greeting, talking, making moral judgements, etc. This basic aspect has to do with activities that are necessary given man’s biological nature (eating, sleeping, etc.). These basic human activities and practices are universal, because they are constitutive of human life ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 145).
	- The transcendental conditions are transcendental in the sense that they are prior to [[experience|experience]] and empirical research ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 147).


## Socio-cultural aspect of the human form of life
- 0 is fundamentally socio-cultural ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 33).
	- Culture is internally related to the human animal. There is no pre-cultural 0. [[culture|Culture]] and [[language|language]] “go hand in hand, and they are part and parcel of the 0” ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 33). 
- 0 is characterized by the [[universal customs|universal customs]] ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 33).
