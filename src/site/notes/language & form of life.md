# language & form of life
- To imagine a [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] is to imagine a form of life ([[@wittgenstein2009|PI]], ยง19).
	- The idea of language as a form of life, like the idea of a [[language-game (Wittgenstein)|language-game]], is to be set over against the idea of language as an abstract system of signs for representing how things are ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 54-55).
	- Form of life is intended to evoke the idea that speaking a language is a way of conducting oneself with words in a life with others ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 55).
- Form of life is shaped by the use of language ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 62).
	- That precisely means that our form of life is fundamentally cultural in nature ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 62).
