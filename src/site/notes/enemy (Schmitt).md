# enemy (Schmitt)
- The political enemy need not be morally evil or aesthetically ugly ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 27).
- 0 is the other, the stranger; he is existentially something different and alien ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 27).
- In extreme cases there is a possibility of conflicts with the 0 ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 27).
- “0 exists only when, at least potentially, one fighting collectivity of people confronts a similar collectivity” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 28).
- 0 is solely the public enemy ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 28).
- To the 0 concept belongs the ever present possibility of combat ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 32).
- McCormick argues that the political, the postulation of an 0 “serves to distract from the discomfort… of not knowing who oneself (or) one’s culture… is in modernity” ([[@mccormick1999|McCormick 1999]], 233).
- Jay argues that the hated other is needed to create the solidarity of the homogeneous self ([[@jay1993|Jay 1993]], 193).
- 0 is a threat to the relations of [[friendship|friendship]] internal to the [[state|state]] ([[@norris1998|Norris 1998]], 74).

## Existential interpretation of the enemy
- 0 is our own question ([[@schmitt1991|Schmitt 1991]], 243; [[@schmitt2002|Schmitt 2002]], 89-90; see also [[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
	- 0 is a figure for our own question ([[@schmitt1991|Schmitt 1991]], 243). 0 is our own question as Gestalt ([[@schmitt1991|Schmitt 1991]], 243). 0 is alone who can put me in question ([[@schmitt2002|Schmitt 2002]], 89-90).
	- 0 is the one who existentially puts me in question ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87-88). 0 is defined by this very act ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 88). 0 doles out my [[identity|identity]] to me by this very act ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 88).
- 0 grants me my humanity ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
	- Enemy does it by way of activating the uniquely human existential stance of finding oneself enduringly put in question ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
	- “The detour through the tangle of the enemy, the existential question, the imminent threat of mortality, and hence a finite life, puts me face-to-face with myself and, in so doing, fuels the liveliness, the vivacity, ob my life, in the same way that [[Heidegger|Heidegger’s]] “[[being-toward-death (Heidegger)|being-toward-death (Heidegger)]]” gives one a chance to live otherwise, holding onto the promise of authenticity, however errant and ephemeral” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 88).
- “A final response to the question of the enemy causes the degeneration of all questioning impulses and the dissipation of politics into a pure negation” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 95).
- 0 accomplishes the real work of heteronomy, unhinging and maintaining undone the figure of the human conceived as “an open question” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 87).
