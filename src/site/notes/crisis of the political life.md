# crisis of the political life
- The experience of the [[political|political]] at the founding level of the [[life-world|life-world]] has been suppressed by the founded institutionalization of politics that presupposes and extirpates this lived, embodied, existential basis ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 128).
- 0 evinces a divergence between the institutional arrangement and its existential premises ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 128).
	- “On the political side of things, the crisis evinces a divergence between the institutional arrangement, such as the [[state|state]], and its existential premises—collective decisions on the form of political existence, formations of the [[community|community]] of friends against [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] groupings, and so on—and it is these ‘groundless,’ existentially self-legitimating political foundations that fall prey to neutralization.” ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 128).
- There is the [[objectivation|objectivization]] of the [[political|political]] in modernity ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 128).
	- Its divestment of any subjective underpinnings uncritically dismissed as archaic despotism ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 128). 
- [[Schmitt|Schmitt]] confronts the loss of the [[political world|political life-world]] ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 129).
	- Constitution-making power is worn out in that which is [[constitution|constituted]] by it; existentially vibrant meaning gives way to legalistic [[abstraction|abstractions]] ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 129).
- Schmitt’s own accentuation of the elemental experience of the [[political|political]] is also [[context|contextually]] and [[history|historically]] ensconced in a reaction to the [[crisis|crisis]] of [[modernity|modernity]] ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 129).
	- This crisis of modernity is threatening with a complete de-policization, neutralization, and formalization of human existence ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 129).
