# psychological reduction
- 0 reduces the being of an [[object|object]] or a [[state of affairs|state of affairs]].
	- 0 “inhibits every perceptual positing of the object (under consideration) and of any other transcendent object” ([[@husserl1968|Hua IX]], 188).
	- “… whether the perceived object exist or not, whither the perceiving person is mistaken about this or not, and also whether I, the psychologist, who in my empathetic understanding of the person unhesitatingly concur in the belief in the perceived object, am mistaken about it or not – this must remain irrelevant for me as a psychologist” ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 236).
- 0 is a modalization of a validity of an [[lived-experience|act]] ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 237).
- 0 “delivers to us… the pure, in itself closed domain of psychic phenomena in their concrete and total unity” ([[@husserl1968|Hua IX]], 188).
- 0 does not reach the “self-enclosed field” of its subject matter, has not yet arrived at a “pure soul” ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 239).
- 0 must be universally carried out ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 240).
	- It must not be meant as a critical [[epoché|epoché]] or as a generally philosophical undertaking, as a universal critique of [[experience|experience]], of the possibility of knowledge of truths-in-themselves for an objectively existing [[world|world]], etc. ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 240).
- 0 is a kind of [[reduction|reduction]] in [[Husserl|Husserl’s]] [[phenomenology|phenomenology]]. It is also one of the three familiar [[ways into phenomenology|ways into phenomenology]]. 
- “The genuine phenomenologica-psychological epoché is an attitude which is completely strange and artificial not only to the whole of natural life but also to the psychologist of the past” ([[@husserl1970|Husserl 1970]], 248).
- 0 necessarily modifies subjective experience in comparison to natural, non-scientific self-reflection ([[@staiti2014|Staitit 2014]], 185). “While the occasional consideration of our subjective experience in everyday life does not affect the positings of existence entailed in the experience under scrutiny, a purely psychological consideration has to target and suspend all extra-mental being and focus exclusively on [[act (Husserl)|experiences]] qua experiences” ([[@staiti2014|Staiti 2014]], 185-186).
- 0 is a [[methodology|methodological]] move releases or leaves outside-the-game what, from the natural attitude, was presumed as realistic within or behind the appearing phenomena ([[@theodorou2015|Theodorou 2015]], 27). 0 offers the possibility of abstracting from the issue regarding the realistic existence or not of the appearing thing and of restraining ourselves methodologically to whatever appears as a phenomenon. The appearing treats as the [[intentionality (Husserl)|intentional]] recognition of a thing in consciousness; it can be treated within the limits of the psychological sphere as the sphere of [[act (Husserl)|intentional acts]] and their transcendently appearing [[object (Husserl)|intentional objects]] (as appearances). 
- The 0 “methodologically transfers the phenomenologist from the realistically understood (in the [[natural attitude|natural attitude]]) intentionally appearing, transcendent thing to its intentional-psychological [[phenomenon|phenomenon]], or, rather, to it as only intentionally appearing phenomenon ([[@theodorou2015|Theodorou 2015]], 27). 
- 0 opens up the [[region|region of being]] of the intentional-psychologically pure consciousness and of the ‘therein’ appearing transcendent phenomena ([[@theodorou2015|Theodorou 2015]], 27).
- The strategy of 0 is to abstractively reflect back from our perceived [[world|world]], which we take as existing, to the mental activities of the [[soul|soul]] ([[@welton2000|Welton 2000]], 268).
	- A soul found only in the world but said to exist in a radically different sense ([[@welton2000|Welton 2000]], 268).



## Dependence of psychological way from cartesian way
- The [[psychological reduction|way to reduction through intentional psychology]] cannot be executed completely independent from [[Cartesian reduction|cartesian way]] ([[@lee1993|@lee1993]], 70). The CW forms the indispensable methodological prerequisite for the PW. Since the PW does not really lead to [[transcendental subjectivity|transcendental subjectivity]] without the insight of [[universal reduction|universal reduction]] gained on CW, one can call the PW a “modification of the CW” ([[@lee1993|@lee1993]], 70-71; [[@husserl1959|Hua VIII]], 316).
