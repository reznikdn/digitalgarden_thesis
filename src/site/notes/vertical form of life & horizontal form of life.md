# vertical form of life & horizontal form of life
- Vertical [[form of life (Wittgenstein)|form of life]] is a biological form of life ([[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424; [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	- Vertical form of life concerns the form of life all human beings share, with all its physiological peculiarities ([[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424).
	- Our use of color terms, for example, is bound up with the distinctive physiology of the human visual system.
	- Vertical form of life is distinguished from other forms of life (higher and lower) ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
- Horizontal form of life is social or ethnological [[form of life (Wittgenstein)|form of life]] ([[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424; [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	- Horizontal form of life concerns ways of life, which humans might or might not share ([[@wittgenstein1956|Wittgenstein 1956]], VI §34; see also [[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424).
	- Horizontal form of life accounts for socio-cultural differences within a form of life ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
- The distinction on biological and ethnological kinds of form of life sets the fase primacy of biological under the cultural ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 30-32).
	- To the [[human form of life|human form of life]] as the general form of human being belongs no only [[extremely general facts of nature|extremely general facts of nature]]. Language, for example is the “second nature we all share” ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 30).
	- “It is impossible to superimpose on man a lower layer of behaviour which one chooses to call ‘natural’, followed by a manufactured cultural or spiritual world. Everything is both manufactured and natural in man, as it were, in the sense that there is not a word, not a form of behaviour which does not owe something to purely biological being – and which at the same time does not elude the simplicity of animal life, and cause forms of vital behaviour to deviate from their pre-ordained direction, through a sort of leakage and through a genius for ambiguity which might serve to define man.” ([[@merleau-ponty2012|Merleau-Ponty 2012]], 220)
	- There is “the mutual absorption of the natural and the social” ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]], 330). “The human is irreducibly social and natural” ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]], 353).
