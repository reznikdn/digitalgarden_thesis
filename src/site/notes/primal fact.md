# primal fact
- 0
	- 0 является пределом [[modalization|модализации]] опыта ([[@chernavin2011|@chernavin2011]], 83).
	- 0 have an a-posteriori and [[apodictic evidence|apodictic]] character ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222). 0 are absolutely self-given and thus the condition for the possibility of the existence of every other fact.
	- Originary experience of these primal facts is not modalizable ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222). There is an ‘impossibility of modalization’ (Unmodalisierbarkeit) resulting from their absoluteness and apodicticity is to be regarded as the criterion that distinguishes these primal facts from facts in the common sense.
	- 0 are [[ego (Husserl)|I]], [[world (Husserl)|world]], bodily existence, [[intersubjectivity (Husserl)|intersubjectivity]], [[history (Husserl)|historicity]], space, [[time (Husserl)|time]] ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222).
- the primal fact of the hylē
	- 0 = originary sensibility ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222), special [[primal fact|primal fact]] ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 223)
	- 0 is the ultimate originary structure on which all other primal facts are grounded ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222). This special primal fact enlivens all other primal facts, endows them with an [[affective force|affective power]] that can only be bodily sensed.
	- This originary sensibility, this fundamental affectivity of the [[hyle (Husserl)|hyle]], this “sensuousness devoid of [[ego (Husserl)|Ego]]” (ichlose Sensualität) is charactarized as an “originary vitality” (ursprüngliche Lebendigkeit) or a [[drive-intentionality|universal drive intentionality]] (universale Treibintentionalität) and can therefore be understood as an originaty drive ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222). 
	- 0 cannot appeat in itself, but only through other primal facts ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 222-223).
- I as a primal fact
	- “I am the primal fact in this process, I recognize, that in addition to my factual ability for [[eidetic reduction|eidetic reduction]], these and those own primal stock of components yield to me as primal structures of my facticity in respones to my factual retrospective inquiries… I cannot go beyond my factual I” ([[@husserl1973b|Hua XV]], 386).
	- Interestingly, this insight leads [[Husserl|Husserl]] to posit the [[apodictic evidence|apodictical]] facticity of the world as well as of the I ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 219).
- contingency of primal facts
	- Contingency not only characterizes the “core” of the primal facts but even the ego’s very essence due to its qualitative “openness” ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 213).
	- But in other passages Breuer claims that ‘facticity’ of [[primal fact|primal facts]] does not mean a contingent fact whose not-being is possible, but a ‘primal fact’ which precedes any contingent fact and apodictivally makes every positing of reality possible ([[@breuer2020|@breuer2020]], 223).
