# language-game & form of life
- [[language-game (Wittgenstein)|Language-game]] is not the [[form of life (Wittgenstein)|form of life]] ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 37).
- Language-game is a part of form of life ([[@garver1994|Garver 1994]], 246).
	- The correlation between language-game and form of life is many to one rather than one to one ([[@garver1994|Garver 1994]], 246). 
	- “… the word ‘[[language-game (Wittgenstein)|language-game]]' is used here to emphasize the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life” ([[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]], § 23; cf. ibid., § 19).
	- The religious (being religious) is a form of life, but speaking religiously is not; speaking religiously is speaking from the perspective of a religious form of life ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 38).
	- “Language has no segregated existence; words are always embedded in a form of life” ([[@harris1988|Harris 1988]], 113).
  - Language-games are conditioned by our forms of life ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 38).
	  - The form of life be the given from which languages can emerge ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 38).
