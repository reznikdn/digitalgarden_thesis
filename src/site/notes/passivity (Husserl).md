# passivity (Husserl)
- 0
	- 0 is a dimension of experience that a [[regressive inquiry|regressive inquiry]] into [[originality (Husserl)|origins]] unearths, and which serves as a point of departure for an explicative [[genetic phenomenology|genetic]] account that traces [[motivation (Husserl)|motivations]] leading back “up” to cognitive activity ([[@steinbock2012|@steinbock2012]], xxxviii).
	- 0 is that realm in which, through fundamental laws of [[association (Husserl)|association]], [[affectivity|affective forces]] spur an [[attention (Husserl)|egoic attentiveness]] to [[object (Husserl)|objects]], enabling [[act (Husserl)|acts]] of remembering and expectation to [[constitution (Husserl)|constitute]] objects as such ([[@steinbock2012|@steinbock2012]], xxxviii).
	- Passivities are “modes of background-consciousness, modes of having something in consciousness without being directed towards it” ([[@husserl1992|Hua XXIX]], 247; cit. by [[@pulkkinen2013|Pulkkinen 2013]], 130; see also [[@husserl2000|Hua 31]], 4). Passivity is the exact opposite of [[attention (Husserl)|attentional]] focus of conscious attention: it denotes the silent and anonymous functioning of consciousness in the background of attention ([[@pulkkinen2013|@pulkkinen2013]], 130).  
- kinds of passivity
	- [[pre-world|pure passivity]]
	- [[secondary passivity|secondary passivity]]
- five meanings of passivity according to Steinbock
	1. A lawful, fundamental regularity in the way in which [[sense|sense]] is [[constitution (Husserl)|constituted]], as a mode of sense-genesis ([[@steinbock2012|@steinbock2012]], xxxviii). This enables [[Husserl|Husserl]] to speak about [[passive genesis|passive genesis]].
	2. A sphere of experience in which the [[ego (Husserl)|ego]] is not [[activity (Husserl)|active]], i.e., does not creatively participate or actively orient itself in the constitution of sense. Here, [[passive synthesis|passive synthesis]] refers to productions of sense formed through [[association (Husserl)|associative connections]] that take place prior to the occurrences of higher lying activities, which in their turn cognitively fix a common element or actively make comparisons. 
	3. Passivity as basically equivalent to [[perception (Husserl)|perceptual]], [[pre-predicativity|pre-predicative]], pre-reflective, pre-linguistic experience, which has an implicit [[teleology (Husserl)|teleological]] orientation to [[reason (Husserl)|reason]]. Passivity as a realm of bodily [[habituality (Husserl)|habits]] t hat were once actively acquired and [[sedimentation (Husserl)|sedimented]]. 
	4. A sphere of [[pregivenness|pregivenness]] and objectlike formations. 
	5. As the realm of [[perception (Husserl)|perceptual]] and aesthetic experience it is the basis for [[activity (Husserl)|activity]] as the realm of cognitive and logical experience. Passivity is a founding level of experience, the subsoil of creative life, provides the basic, essential conditions of the possibility of a subjectivity itself.
