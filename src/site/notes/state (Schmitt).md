# state (Schmitt)
- 0 is the political status of an organized people in an enclosed territorial unit ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 19).
	- [[Schmitt|Schmitt]] argues that this is not a definition but a general paraphrase.
- 0 is a political entity ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 45).
- 0 decides for itself the [[friend-enemy distinction (Schmitt)|friend-enemy distinction]] ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 29-30).
- To the 0 belongs the [[jus belli|jus belli]] ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 45).
	- I.e., the real possibility of deciding in a concrete situation upon the enemy and the ability to fight him with the power emanating from the entity ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 45).
- 0 has the possibility of waging war and thereby publicly disposing of the lives of men ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 46).
- A normal 0 has an enterprise to ensure “total peace” within the 0 and its territory ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 46).
- As long as 0 exists, there will always be in the world more than just one 0 ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 53).
- Statehood is not a universal concept valid for all times and all peoples ([[@schmitt2003|Schmitt 2003]], 127).
