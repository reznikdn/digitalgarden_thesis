# political entity (Schmitt)
- 0 presupposes the real existence of an [[enemy (Schmitt)|enemy]] and therefore coexistence with another 0 ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 53).
- 0 cannot be universal ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 53).
	- “If… all humanity and the entire world were to become a unified entity based exclusively on economics and on technically regulating traffic, then it is still world not be more of a social entity than a social entity of tenants in a tenement house, customers purchasing gas from the same utility company, or passengers traveling on the same bus” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 57).
- 0 does not need to be a [[state (Schmitt)|state]], as long as the intensity of association and antagonism  within it reaches the qualitative “boiling point” of the [[political (Schmitt)|political]] ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 120).
