# the other & the alien
- [[Husserl|Husserl]] does not offer such a distinction of 0 ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 57).
- To characterize [[the alien|the alien]] as [[the other|the other]] is to juxtapose the other to myself in a linear fashion ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 59).
	- An alien culture is not a second culture ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 59).  A “Fremdsprache” is not just a “second language”: it is a “foreign language”.
- The [[home-world|home-world]] is not “the first world” and the [[alien-world|alien-world]] is not “the second” ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 59).
	- In distinction of the [[home-world|Heimwelt]] and [[alien-world|Fremdwelt]] Husserl uses “Fremdwelt” and not the “Anderwelt” ([[@steinbock1995|Steinbock 1995]], 58).
- [[the alien|The alien]] is not “the second subject”; and the other (the alter ego) is indeed the second one.
