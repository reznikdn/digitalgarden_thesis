# world as totality
- The constitutional scheme of 0 is analogous to the constitutional scheme of concrete objectivities ([[@geniusas2012|Geniusas 2012]], 180). To speak of the horizon of the world as the totality of objectivities is to employ the same constitutive schema that pertains to each and every objectivity. [[@husserl1950a|Hua III/1]] начинается как: "Мир есть тотальность предметов возможного опыта..." Мир - это тотальность, которая включает в себя всё, что есть, не будучи сущим ([[@welton2000|Welton 2000]], 74).
- To concieve the world as totality is to suggest that the world – as the object – has its core of direct and immediate manifestation, which in its own turn is apperceived as the appearance of the world ([[@geniusas2012|@geniusas2012]], 180). Here the [[horizon (Husserl)|horizon]] reveals itself as something relative and preliminary: what is not given to me in direct [[intuition_Husserl|intuition]], either is or can be intuited by others and thus can also be be given to me.
- For [[Husserl|Husserl]] (as for [[Heidegger|Heidegger]]) world cannot [[phenomenology|phenomenologically]] be described as a totality of entities ([[@overgaard2004|@overgaard2004]], 127).

## Criticism of the world as the totality of objectivities
- [[Husserl|Husserl]] in his latter works says that there is an [[essence (Husserl)|essential]] difference between the being of the world and the being of objects: “There exists a fundamental difference between the way we are conscious of the world ([[world-consciousness|world-consciousness]]) and the way we are conscious of thing or objects ([[object-consciousness|object-consciousness]])” ([[@husserl1954|Hua VI]], 146). These indications intimate a [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] notion of the world as [[world-horizon|world-horizon]].
