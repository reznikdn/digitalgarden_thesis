# horizon
- 0 presupposes an observing perspective which in turn purports the presence of an [[observer|observer]] ([[@kwan1990|Kwan 1990]], 363).
- 0 is not something that exist objectively ([[@kwan1990|Kwan 1990]], 362).
	- The contour of a particular mountain range or the coastal line of a particular island or continent can be considered objective in a certain sense ([[@kwan1990|Kwan 1990]], 363).
	- But a 0 in a [[phenomenology|phenomenological]] sense is quite different â€“ there is no objectively existent 0, for 0 always presupposes a particular observing perspective ([[@kwan1990|Kwan 1990]], 363).
