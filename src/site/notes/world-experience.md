# world-experience
- 0
	- 0 is thematic and up to degree intuitive [[givenness (Husserl)|givenness]] of the [[world-horizon|world-horizon]] ([[@geniusas2012|@geniusas2012]], 178).
	- [[Geniusas|Geniusas]] calls [[world-horizon|world-horizon]] given in 0 [[universal horizon|world as wherein of experience]] and [[life-world (Husserl)|world as whereto of experience]] ([[@geniusas2012|@geniusas2012]], 179).
	- The [[background-foreground schema|background-foreground schema]] gives rise not only to the appearance of [[object (Husserl)|concrete objectivities]]; it generates the [[intentional implication|implication]] of [[potential horizon|potential horizons]] within the actual one, which, once taken in its concrete endlessness, is nothing other than 0.
- kinds of world-experience
	- We can aim to extract what the implication of all horizons within the actual one means by disclosing the formal structure of the [[universal horizon|world as horizon of all horizons]] – and then we can get the notion of [[universal horizon|world as the wherein of experience]] ([[@geniusas2012|@geniusas2012]], 197). And we can also thematize the interweaving of horizons by paying heed to the concrete and constant transformations of sense that such an Ineinander brings forth – and the we can get the notion of [[life-world (Husserl)|world as the whereto of experience]].
