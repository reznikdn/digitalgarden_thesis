# psychological reduction & ontological reduction
- 0
	- [[Bower|Bower]] suggests that [[ontological reduction|ontological]] and [[psychological reduction|psychological]] ways into [[phenomenology|phenomenology]] are “really the same”, but only with different emphases ([[@bower2020|@bower2020]], 192). He says: “It is not surprising, then, to find that in certain early formulations [[Husserl|Husserl]] lays out his psychological reduction within the context of a [[reflection|reflection]] of the whole of ontology”. Moreover, he says that the ontological reduction only succeeds if it takes the “psychical” into account ([[@bower2020|@bower2020]], 193). Bower concludes that “the only difference between the ontological and the psychological reduction is that, whereas the descriptive psychologist is interested from the start in intentional [[consciousness|consciousness]], when one theorizes about other [[region|ontological regions]] one first has to discover their insufficiency ([[@bower2020|@bower2020]], 193).
