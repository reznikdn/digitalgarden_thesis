# Political as a Figure of Otherness




## Ontology of the Political World
- World (Welt) = [[life-world (Husserl)|life-world]] (Lebenswelt) = [[experienced world|experienced world]] (Erfahrungswelt).
- [[world (Husserl)|World]] is a multidimensional sense-formation (multidimensionales Sinngebilde) ([[@sowa2008|Sowa 2008]], LXI; [[@lee2019|Lee 2019]], 49-50).
	- ==Назвать эти измерения==
	- ==Сказать, что есть monistic и pluralistic взгляды==
- There is a plurality of particular worlds.

Let’s suppose that:
- There is a political world.

If so, then:
- Political world should have its own way of appearance and thematization.
	- There is should be a possibility of the ontology of the political world.

Klaus Held offers the following way of disclosing the phenomenon of the [[political world|political world]]:
- There is a distinction between the [[the one world|world as such]] and the plurality of the [[particular world|particular worlds]].
	- The postulate of [[natural attitude|natural attitude]] presupposes that every our action directed toward things, deeds, plans, and concerns, conceals the [[horizon (Husserl)|horizons]] through which any directionality becomes possible at all. The [[situation|situation]] itself and the structure of [[habituality (Husserl)|habitualities]] must stay in the background so that we are able to deal with the foreground. Of course, sometimes the background reveals itself: we notice that “we are in an awkward situation”, that “it is only our opinion”, that “we are in a wrong place“. But the key achievement of the natural attitude is that when we notice the background, we immediately change this noticing on the new interpretation, on the new foreground. Our experience stays [[concordance|concordant]] and unanimous. Yes, we misunderstood the situation, we misunderstood the state of affairs. But the break of the situation does not lead to the breaking of the whole world: I am still a human being in the world, I still stay on their own two feet. The natural attitude presupposes the unthematizable and uninterrupted world as [[the one world|the one world]], as an all-encompassing [[universal horizon|universal horizon]] in which all our particular horizons are nested and change each other.
- The one world could be thematized through the break of the natural attitude / The one world could be thematized through the institution of the philosophical attitude.
	- The [[philosophical attitude|philosophical attitude]] first established by [[Heraclitus|Heraclitus]] allows us to break this spell of naturalness, to cast off the shackles of confinement in the particular worlds and to [[thematization|thematize]] the world as [[the one world|the one world]]. [[philosophy|Philosophy]] makes it possible for the first time to grasp the world as our “common” world and to distinguish it from the plurality of the ==doxa==.
- Because the philosophical attitude exists, there should be its conditions of possibility.
	- The possibility that we remain the prisoners of our [[particular world|particular worlds]] is a limit (extreme) case of the the natural attitude.
	- Because there is an [[episteme|episteme]], there must be a world-open form of 0, which is not yet episteme ([[@held2012|Held 2012]], 451).
	- Doxa does not hold us completely under its spell
- We have the ability to thematize our own absorption by doxa and to have empathetic awareness of the [[horizon|horizons]] of [[the other|others]].
- Political world is a mediator between the natural attitude and the philosophical attitude.
- As a particular world political world should have its own event of [[primal institution|primal institution]] (Urstiftung) in the generative history of the [[personality of a higher order|community]].

==Здесь написать, что объяснения Хельда не хватает. Оно застревает на на “политическом пространстве” обсуждения собственных горизонтов. Радикализация рассуждения Хельда – это рассмотрение политического как инаковости, как чуждости, как враждебности, как другого способа жизни, задающего вопрос твоему собственному. Как чужому горизонту, с которым ты сталкиваешься. Это объяснение мы находим в философии Шмитта в её экзистенциально-политической интерпретации”.

- Political world is a pluriverse, not a universe ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 53).
 - Political describes not “its own substance but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings” ([[@schmitt2008|Schmitt 2008]], 38).
- It is doubtful whether the political has its own area ([[@marder2010|Marder 2010]], 63).

## Passive genesis of the political world

==Здесь нужно будет сказать, что политическое – это историческое априори. Это учреждение на пути телеологии человечества как сообщества любви.
Политическое как часть телеологического движения человечества.==
