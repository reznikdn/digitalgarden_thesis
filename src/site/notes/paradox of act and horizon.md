# paradox of act and horizon
- paradox of act and horizon
	- [[Bower|Bower]] takes two following presuppositions: 1) all [[horizon (Husserl)|horizons]] that put us in contact with transcendent reality, and ultimately the [[world-horizon|world-horizon]] embracing them all, are the products of [[act (Husserl)|intentional acts]]; 2) every intentional act presupposes a horizon ([[@bower2013|@bower2013]], 66; see also [[@husserl2003|Hua Mat VIII]], 349). Taken together these presuppositions form an infinite regress. This paradox, moreover, implies an infinite series of intentional acts. [[Husserl|Husserl’s]] resolution to paradox is to appeal to unique non-worldly [[intentionality (Husserl)|intentionality]] out if which worldly intentionality arises – the sphere of [[pre-world|pre-world]].
