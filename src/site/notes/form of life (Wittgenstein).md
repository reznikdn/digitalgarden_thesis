# form of life(Wittgenstein)
- 0 is the actions intertwined with [[language use|language use]] within a given [[culture|culture]] ([[@gonzalez-castan2016|González-Castán 2016]], 123).
- 0 is the [[sociology|sociological]], [[history (science)|historical]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] determinants that comprise the matrix within which a given [[language|language]] has meaning ([[@gonzalez-castan2016|González-Castán 2016]], 123).
- 0 forms the necessary background or context or foundation of meaning ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 25).
	- 0 is not a single way of acting, but must include innumerable other such shared ways of acting that cohesively form the necessary background or context or foundation of meaning ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 25).
	- We cannot justify our 0, because we have to take them as given when we justify our [[belief|beliefs]], claims and [[practice|practices]] ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 142).
- 0 is what has to be accepted ([[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]], 344-345).
	- “What has to be accepted, the given, is – so one could say – forms of life” ([[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]], 344-345). What [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] means is that we cannot choose whether to engage in those basic activities and [[practice|practices]] that are constitutive of human life ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 142).
	- “The 0 is not grounded on something more fundamental; it is the fundament” ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 24). 0 is a stopping-place of doubt; 0 is a place of complete agreement, without which human beings could learn no [[language (Wittgenstein)|language]] ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 23-24).
- 0 is used rarely in Wittgensteins works.
	- [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] uses the term “0” only five times in [[@wittgenstein2009|Wittgenstein 2009]] and about ten times in his other writings ([[@saari2005|Saari 2005]], 141). For other writings see [[@wittgenstein1998|Wittgenstein 1998–2000]], Item 119, 74v, Item 133, 28r, Item 165, 110, Item 176, 51v.


## Levels of form of life
- There are [[human form of life|human form of life]] & [[form of human life|forms of human life]] ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 78; see also [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	- The secondary literature concerning the 0 has primarily focused on the question of whether there is only one shared human form of life or multiple forms of life ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 97). This situation (as is commonly known) arose in connection with [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein’s]] use of the term in [[@wittgenstein2009|Philosophical Investigations]] both in the singular and plural form.
	- “One could say that all humans participate in the human form of life, but that there can be different forms of human life” ([[@conway1989|Conway 1989]], 78). Conway distinguishes the human 0 from the 0 of other beings, but takes the crucial dichotomy for [[Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] to be the one human 0 versus the different 0 ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26).
	- “Where the acquisition of [[language|language]] belongs to the human 0, the acquisition of cartography, of algebra, or of parliamentary elections attaches only to some of the various forms of human life” ([[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 27).
- There are “the” form of life & “a” form of life ([[@thompson2010|Thompson 2010]], 97-98).
	- But we will identify “the” form of life with the [[human form of life|human form of life]] & “a” form of life with the [[form of human life|forms of human life]] (R.D., 220603).
- There are [[vertical form of life & horizontal form of life|vertical form of life & horizontal form of life]] ([[@cavell1996|Cavell 1996]]; see also [[@moyal-sharrock2015|Moyal-Sharrock 2015]], 26; [[@whiting2017|Whiting 2017]], 424).
	- But we will concern this dichotomy as false (R.D., 220603).


## Concept of life in the form of life
- Concept of life in 0 means not a biological life.
	- Concept of life in 0 means not a biological life, and not an ahistorical idea of the life of a particular species ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 55). 0 applies rather to a historical groups of individuals who are bound together into a community by a shared set of complex language-involving practices ([[@mcginn2013|McGinn 2013]], 55).
	- Coming to share the 0 of a group of individual human beings means mastering the intricate [[language-game (Wittgenstein)|language-games]] that, in part at least, constitute it.
