# individuum
- 0
	- 0 is a “this-here” whose material essence is a [[concretum (Husserl)|concretum]] ([[@husserl1950a|Hua III/1]], 30).
	- 0 is the [[primal object|primal object]] required from a purely logical point of view, the logically absolute, to which all logical ‘variations’ refer back ([[@husserl1950a|Hua III/1]], 30).
	- Understanding the concept of “individual” is thus identifying what [[Husserl|Husserl]] takes to be as the [[primal object|Urgegenstand]], the most fundamental concept of [[logic|logic]] and [[ontology|ontology]] ([[@majolino2015|@majolino2015]], 35).
- [[object (Husserl)|individual object]] and individuum
	- individual is broader than individuum ([[@desantis2021|@desantis2021]], 216). An “individual color” understood as the “individualization” of the [[eidetic singularity|eidetic singularity]] “ruby red,” is not an individuum, for its [[essence (Husserl)|essence]] is of a non-independent nature ([[abstractum_Husserl|abstractum]]).
